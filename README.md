## Pokecryption
A crude encryption tool that uses pokemon as RSA keys. This is by no means a secure encryption tool, but I thought it would be funny.

Inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cz8cXHjAP4)

## Usage
Python must be installed on the system along with the `requests` library. To run the program, run the `pokecrypt.py` file.
Place files to encrypt in the `unencrypted` folder and follow the prompts to encrypt, decrypt, or generate new keys.
